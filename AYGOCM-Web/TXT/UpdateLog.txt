        Revamped UI to align with Java Edition's for a smoother experience.

    Fixes/Changes:
        Fixed random errors that occured on various areas of the app
        Updated URLs for news page, update checker, etc. As they were broken.
        Card library now sorts folders (like from .ydk import) into separate tabs.
        Better move card library logic.
